# Sand Simulation in JS

## Description

I've made a tiny project, for making litteraly a sandbox. Dot represents sand, and there is gravity a there is some bugs. I juststarted JS with this project with the library p5.js.

I stop this project because some of the bugs are *(for me)* to hard to fix. (need to refactor the code & to lazy for this)

This project has started with this tweet of a sand simulation : [here](https://twitter.com/matthen2/status/1712943867765383371?s=46) ,and I started to recreate the video

## The code

the calculus of the sand is made in 2x2 like the video, the calculus was a idea from my friend so he helped me to made it.

The code is very simple to understand.

## The bugs known

- The sand is not going to the left.
- The sand in the right ledge is not impacted by the gravity.

## Final

The code is not perfect, but it's a good start for me.
You can do whatever with the code, this is not even a big code so I don't care if you not credit me.
